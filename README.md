# Encryption and Decryption Tool

A Python-based tool for securely encrypting and decrypting text using the AES and RSA algorithms. This project provides a simple graphical interface for encrypting and decrypting data. It uses the `pycryptodome` library for secure encryption and `tkinter` to handle the user interface.
